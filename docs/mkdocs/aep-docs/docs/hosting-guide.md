# Introduction

At Kainos, we manage hundreds of build systems across many projects, and we know that this can lead to unnecessary repetition when it comes to building common tools. Siloes can be a barrier to experimentation, and with generative AI, the opportunities to experiment are seemingly endless.

That's why we built the AI Enhanced Platform (AEP) and made it Open Source. AEP is a platform that provides your organisation with easy-to-use Generative AI workflows, and a framework to experiment with your own.

## How AEP can help your Organisation

AEP is designed to help your organisation in the following ways:

- **Consistency**: Provide a consistent way to interact with large language models and community tooling so you can get started right away.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce the time and resources needed to build AI-backed DevOps tooling, with an average cost per developer at Â£2 per month.
- **Experimentation**: A framework to experiment with your own Generative AI workflows, enabling your organisation to move quickly.
- **Support**: Support your adoption by using our messaging and guidance to help your engineers and customers understand the tools.
- **Collaboration**: Use the framework to build and share your own AEP-integrated tools and templates.
