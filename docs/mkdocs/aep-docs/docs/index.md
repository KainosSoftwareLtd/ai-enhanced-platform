# Introduction

Welcome to AI Enhanced Platform (AEP), your companion to seamlessly interact with large language models. 

Empower your DevOps journey with AI-driven insights and assistance. ðŸš€

## What is AEP?

We know that engineers and architects want to build AI-backed tooling, but they don't always have the time or resources to do so. That's where AEP comes in. AEP is a platform that provides your project with easy-to-use Generative AI workflows, and a framework to experiment with your own. 

If you're looking to support engineers in the use of, and ability to build, AI-driven tooling, read our [Hosting Guide](hosting-guide.md).

### AEP Pillars

The three pillars of AEP are:

- A pre-built set of templates, tools and examples to get started.
- We provide you with the assurance, messaging and guidance to help your engineers and customers understand the tools.
- A framework to build and share your own AEP-integrated tools and templates.

### User Journey
